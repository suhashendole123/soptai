## Project setup
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```
### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
### I am using JSON API from https://github.com/typicode/json-server. Data will be saved to a JSON file, so we donâ€™t have to make our own back end add to save some simple data. We install the server by running 
```
npm i -g json-server
```
### Then once that is done, inside project directory run

```
json-server --watch db.json
```
## Additional option of LocalStorage is added to access data quickly without setup of any json server

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
